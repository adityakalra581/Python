### [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution. Please see the companion informational PEP describing style guidelines for the C code in the C implementation of Python.
This document and PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions) were adapted from Guido's original Python Style Guide essay, with some additions from Barry's style guide .
This style guide evolves over time as additional conventions are identified and past conventions are rendered obsolete by changes in the language itself.

### [PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

- Abstract

This PEP documents the semantics and conventions associated with Python docstrings.

- Rationale

The aim of this PEP is to standardize the high-level structure of docstrings: what they should contain, and how to say it (without touching on any markup syntax within docstrings). The PEP contains conventions, not laws or syntax.
